# Yahtzee

Implement a round of the game Yahtzee, where 5 dice are randomly rolled, and the function returns what options the user has to score more than 0 points. Extra credit: implement all 13 rounds!

## Example

```
yahtzeeRound()
> { dice: [2,2,3,3,3],
    options: ["twos","threes","full house","three of a kind","chance"]
  }

yahtzeeRound()
> { dice: [2,3,4,2,2],
    options: ["twos","threes","fours","three of a kind","chance"]
  }

yahtzeeRound()
> { dice: [4,3,6,3,5],
    options: ["threes","fours","fives","sixes","small straight","chance"]
  }
```

# Week 47

Given an array of integers representing the stock prices of a company in chronological order, write a function that determines the maximum profit you can achieve by buying and selling the stock once. If no profit can be made, return 0.

Example:

```
> maxTheStock([7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4])
> 5 // (buy at 1, sell at 6)

> maxTheStock([7, 6, 4, 3, 1])
> 0 // (no profit possible)
```
